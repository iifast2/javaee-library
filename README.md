# javaee-library
JavaEE, Tomcat, MySQL

I started first JavaEE project and it's web library - not so simple as I thought

right now it's 3am so that's all for today

later I'm going to execute rest of the queries

## MySQL Database
First of all you need to create your database `Library` then you have to create table called `books`
